Algorithm of DFS, BFS and Dijkstra
These algorithms help to walk om graphs and colloct required in formation about graphs.

# DFS
A standard DFS implementation puts each vertex of the graph into one of two categories:

    1.Visited
    2.Not Visited

The purpose of the algorithm is to mark each vertex as visited while avoiding cycles.

The DFS algorithm works as follows:

    1.Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.
    2.Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
    3.Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the top of the stack.
    4.Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.

# BFS
Breadth-first search is a graph traversal algorithm that starts traversing the graph from the root node and explores all the neighboring nodes. Then, it selects the nearest node and explores all the unexplored nodes. While using BFS for traversal, any node in the graph can be considered as the root node.

There are many ways to traverse the graph, but among them, BFS is the most commonly used approach. It is a recursive algorithm to search all the vertices of a tree or graph data structure. BFS puts every vertex of the graph into two categories - visited and non-visited. It selects a single node in a graph and, after that, visits all the nodes adjacent to the selected node.

    Step 1: SET STATUS = 1 (ready state) for each node in G
    Step 2: Enqueue the starting node A and set its STATUS = 2 (waiting state)
    Step 3: Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until QUEUE is empty
    Step 4: Dequeue a node N. Process it and set its STATUS = 3 (processed state).
    Step 5: Enqueue all the neighbours of N that are in the ready state (whose STATUS = 1) and set
    their STATUS = 2
    (waiting state)
    [END OF LOOP]
    Step 6: EXIT

# Dijkstra
Let the node at which we are starting be called the initial node. Let the distance of node Y be the distance from the initial node to Y. Dijkstra's algorithm will initially start with infinite distances and will try to improve them step by step.

    Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.
    Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes. During the run of the algorithm, the tentative distance of a node v is the length of the shortest path discovered so far between the node v and the starting node. Since initially no path is known to any other vertex than the source itself (which is a path of length zero), all other tentative distances are initially set to infinity. Set the initial node as current.[16]
    For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the one currently assigned to the neighbor and assign it the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, the current value will be kept.
    When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again (this is valid and optimal in connection with the behavior in step 6.: that the next nodes to visit will always be in the order of 'smallest distance from initial node first' so any visits after would have a greater distance).
    If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.
    Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new current node, and go back to step 3.

When planning a route, it is actually not necessary to wait until the destination node is "visited" as above: the algorithm can stop once the destination node has the smallest tentative distance among all "unvisited" nodes (and thus could be selected as the next "current").
